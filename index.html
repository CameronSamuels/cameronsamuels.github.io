<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am the CEO, developer, and founder of The bClick Team, and I have made many apps and games including <a href="https://bocracy.com">b-Ocracy</a>, <a href="http://bclick.cameronsamuels.com">bClick</a>, and a <a href="http://fidget.cameronsamuels.com">Fidget Spinner</a> app with over 400,000 downloads.</p>
<p>My latest works are <a href="http://cameronsamuels.com/keycode">KeyCODE</a>, WebAPP, and other related developer tools. I am planning on publishing them as an app for Android, Chrome, and iOS.</p>
<h1>Featured</h1>
<h2>b-Ocracy</h2>
<p><a href="https://bocracy.com">b-Ocracy</a> is a sequel of <a href="http://bclick.cameronsamuels.com">bClick</a>, my very first app that I created when I was nine years old. b-Ocracy is currently in beta and we are planning on publishing it in December 2017.<br />For more details see <a href="https://bocracy.com/betatest">the beta group</a> to view questions and announcements on the status of the game.</p>
<h2>Fidget Spinner</h2>
<p><a href="http://fidget.cameronsamuels.com">Fidget Spinner - the best one</a> is a digital version of a popular fad, the Fidget Spinner. Furthermore, this was my most popular app in the timeframe it was popular. It had over 300,000 installs on the iOS app store, and over 100,000 downloads on the Google Play Store. It was the top 35 app on iOS, and it had over 300 reviews overall.</p>
<h1>Games</h1>
<h2>bClick</h2>
<p><a href="http://bclick.cameronsamuels.com">bClick</a> was the first app I ever made. I made it when I was 9 years old. It is a clicking game inspired by Cookie Clicker. It is like my test dummy app that has made me get better at my coding skills through the years.</p>
<h1>Developer Tools</h1>
<h2>KeyCODE</h2>
<p><a href="http://cameronsamuels.com/keycode">KeyCODE</a> is an web app for finding out JavaScript key codes. You can type any keyboard key to get the code value for it to use in your code.</p>
<h2>PolyGEN</h2>
<p><a href="http://cameronsamuels.com/polygen">PolyGEN</a> is a JavaScript library I made when I needed to generate shapes for Ludum Dare 35. It lets you easily generate a shape on an HTML5 canvas with any amount of sides.</p>
<h1>Coming Soon</h1>
<h2>WebAPP - July 2017</h2>
<p>WebAPP is going to be an iOS app for turning websites into native-like apps. You can input any URL in the settings app and then open WebAPP to use that website as an actual app. You can disable cache unlike non-native web apps. More features will probably come.</p>
<h2>b-Ocracy Update 3</h2>
<p><a href="https://bocracy.com">b-Ocracy</a> Update 3 will come with improvements for the game as well updates for the apps.</p>
