## About Me

I am the CEO, Developer, and founder of The bClick Team, and have made many apps and games including [b-Ocracy](https://bocracy.com), [bClick](http://bclick.cameronsamuels.com), and a [Fidget Spinner](http://fidget.cameronsamuels.com) app with over 400,000 downloads.

My latest works are [KeyCODE](http://keycode.cameronsamuels.com), WebAPP, and other rleated developer tools. I am planning on publishing them as an app for Android, Chrome, and iOS.

## b-Ocracy

[b-Ocracy](https://bocracy.com) is a sequel of [bClick](http://bclick.cameronsamuels.com), my very first app that I created when I was nine years old. b-Ocracy is currently in beta and we are planning on publishing it in December 2017.<br/>
For more details see [the beta group](https://bocracy.com/betatest) to view questions and announcements on the status of the game.
